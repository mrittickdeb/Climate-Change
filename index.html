    <section id="Introduction">
        <h2>Welcome to our Website</h2>
        <p>Climate change refers to long-term shifts in global or regional weather patterns, primarily attributed to human activities like burning fossil fuels and deforestation. The increase in greenhouse gas emissions, such as carbon dioxide, traps heat in the Earth's atmosphere, leading to rising temperatures. This phenomenon contributes to melting ice caps, rising sea levels, extreme weather events, and disruptions to ecosystems, posing significant challenges to both the environment and human societies. Addressing climate change requires global cooperation and sustainable practices to mitigate its impact and build a resilient future. </p>
